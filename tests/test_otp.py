"""Finding 4 + 5 — OTP security properties (HARDENING_SPRINT.md).

Proves the properties that matter for phone-OTP auth, against the SQLite
backend with a tmp DB:
- a wrong code is rejected
- an expired code is rejected even when correct
- a code cannot be replayed after it succeeds once
- too many wrong guesses lock the account, and the correct code is then
  refused while locked
- OTP requests are rate limited once recent failures pile up
- the stored value is a keyed HMAC, not a trivially reversible plain digest

Each test is named for the property it proves.
